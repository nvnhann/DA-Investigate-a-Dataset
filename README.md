# Final Project: Investigate a Dataset - Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction
In this final project, you'll embark on a journey of data analysis using a Jupyter Notebook. Your task is to explore a dataset, pose intriguing questions, and use tools like pandas and NumPy to uncover answers. This project is open-ended, focusing not on a single correct answer but on the process of inquiry and analysis.

### Dataset: No-show Appointments
The dataset, originally sourced from Kaggle, details 100k medical appointments in Brazil, centering on whether patients attend their appointments. Key data points include:
- `ScheduledDay`: The date when the appointment was scheduled.
- `Neighborhood`: Location of the hospital.
- `Scholarship`: Patient's enrollment status in the Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
- Attendance: Encoded as ‘No’ for attendance and ‘Yes’ for absence.

### Get Organized
- For those using the provided workspace, it comes pre-organized with a Jupyter Notebook and datasets.
- If working locally, create a folder containing your Jupyter Notebook and dataset.

## Step Three - Analyze Your Data
Start by brainstorming questions you can answer with your dataset. Analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables, using NumPy and pandas effectively.

## Step Four - Share Your Findings
Create a comprehensive report in Markdown documenting your findings. Ensure a clear distinction between your commentary and code. The report should be submittable as an HTML or PDF file.

## Code Functionality
### Success Criteria
- **Does the code work?** All code should run error-free and reproduce the results.
- **Appropriate use of NumPy and Pandas?** Favor NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and DataFrames over basic Python lists and dictionaries.
- **Good coding practices?** Code should be readable with meaningful variable names and comments.

## Quality of Analysis
### Success Criteria
- **Is a question clearly posed?** The project should state and then address specific questions.
- **Data Wrangling Phase**: Document any data cleaning or transformation.
- **Exploration Phase**: Investigate your questions from multiple angles using a variety of visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Conclusions Phase**: Reflect on your findings, acknowledge limitations, and avoid implying causation from correlation.

## Communication
### Success Criteria
- **Analysis Flow**: The report should be structured with clear sections and logical reasoning.
- **Appropriate Data Visualization**: Use visualizations that effectively convey your findings with proper labels, scale, and plot types.
